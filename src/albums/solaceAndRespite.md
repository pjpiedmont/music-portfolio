Solace and Respite is an album I'm writing to score my dad's series of short nature videos. My goal with this album is to produce relaxing music that communicates the tranquility of the scenes in the videos. For this album, I've taken a "less is more" approach, layering singable melodies over recognizable chord progressions and filling in the remaining space with lush effects and ear candy, illustrating the emotions captured in my dad's videos.
